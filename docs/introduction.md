# Introduction

Welcome to our documentation! This section provides an overview of our project.

### Sub-Topics:

- **What is the Effect Hook?**

The Effect Hook, introduced in React 16.8, is a feature that allows functional components to perform side effects. These side effects might include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It replaces lifecycle methods in class components.

- **Using the Effect Hook**

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It accepts a function containing imperative, possibly effectful code. This code will be executed after the component renders. 

- **Rules of Hooks**

Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` have certain rules to follow:
    - They should only be called from within React components or custom hooks.
    - They should be called in the same order every time a component renders.
    - They should not be called conditionally.

- **Making API Calls with Hooks**

Hooks can be used to make asynchronous operations like API calls. By utilizing `useEffect` and `useState`, we can fetch data from APIs and manage the response in functional components.

- **Common Pitfalls**

Some common mistakes when working with hooks include forgetting dependencies in the `useEffect` dependency array, accidentally creating infinite loops, and not following the rules of hooks mentioned earlier.
